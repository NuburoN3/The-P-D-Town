Thank you for contributing to The P-D-Town project!

Short checklist:
- Run tests: `npm test`
- Run lint: `npm run lint`
- Run formatter check: `npm run format`
- Add tests for bug fixes and features

Preferred workflow:
1. Fork the repo and create a branch named `feature/short-description`.
2. Make changes, run the project's tests and linters locally.
3. Push the branch and open a PR with a concise description and linked issue.

Coding style:
- Use existing project patterns. Keep functions small and well-named.
- Use `prettier` formatting and follow ESLint warnings.

Testing:
- Every bugfix must include a new test where practical.
- Use `node --test` to run tests.

If you need help, open an issue describing the problem.
